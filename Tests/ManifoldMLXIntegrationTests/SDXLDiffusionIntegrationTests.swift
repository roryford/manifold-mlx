/// Metal-bound integration test for ``MLXDiffusionBackend`` against a real
/// SDXL-Turbo diffusers snapshot.
///
/// Phase D (2026-07-22 companion breakage hunt) found that unlike
/// ``FluxDiffusionBackend``, `MLXDiffusionBackend` has ZERO real-weight
/// coverage anywhere in this repo — `MLXDiffusionBackendTests.swift` is
/// unit-only against a fake `DiffusionGenerator`, and no CLI driver exists
/// either. This is the first real invocation of the SDXL path with actual
/// weights.
///
/// Auto-skips unless:
/// - running on Apple Silicon with a Metal GPU, and
/// - `MANIFOLD_SD_MODEL` points at a directory containing an SDXL-Turbo
///   diffusers-layout snapshot (`unet/`, `vae/`, `text_encoder/`,
///   `text_encoder_2/`, `scheduler/`) — `text_encoder_2/` is what makes it
///   SDXL rather than SD 2.1 Base. A local SDXL-Turbo checkout
///   (`stabilityai/sdxl-turbo`) is the intended target: `detectPreset` picks
///   the SDXL-Turbo preset (cfgWeight 0, steps 2) whenever `text_encoder_2/`
///   is present. These tests hard-assert the SDXL-Turbo preset's own values
///   (steps 2, 1024x1024) — they are NOT a generic SD-family harness; an
///   SD 2.1 Base snapshot (no `text_encoder_2/`, native 768x768) would fail
///   the step-count and image-size assumptions below.
///
/// **Xcode-only** — the MLX metallib is compiled by Xcode, not `swift build`.
/// Run via `scripts/test-mlx-integration.sh`.
///
/// **First run is slow — this is expected, not a hang.** The first real
/// invocation against a fresh `.build` directory pays a one-time Metal shader
/// JIT compile at SDXL's 1024x1024 resolution (a wall of
/// `[Metal Compiler Warning]` lines in the log is normal, not an error) —
/// verified 2026-07-22: ~4 minutes end to end on an Apple Silicon M-series
/// machine. Subsequent runs reuse the compiled shader cache and the actual
/// `generate` test drops to ~9 seconds. Do not kill a run that looks quiet
/// for a few minutes on its first invocation.
///
/// **Generated images are copied to a durable path for human inspection**
/// (`$TMPDIR/manifold-mlx-phase-d/sdxl-turbo-<uuid>.png`, printed to the test
/// log) before the per-test `outDir` is deleted — deliberately unconditional,
/// not gated behind an env var, because the automated byte-size + pixel-
/// variance checks below can pass on a coherent-but-wrong image (right
/// statistics, garbage content) that only a human glance catches.
